## Directions

### Step #1 - Slide the snake <br>

This webpage includes an image of a rather scary snake, but it's hidden right now. In this step, use jQuery's `slideDown()` function to animate the snake coming down from the top of the page. Creepy!
<br><br>
### Step #2 - Announce the snake <br>

In this step, you'll announce the snake once he's slid down from the top. You can do that by adding two parameters to slideDown, an amount to delay and a post-animation callback function. In that callback function, use jQuery to get the <h1> to appear.
